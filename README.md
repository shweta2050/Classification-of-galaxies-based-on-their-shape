# Classification-of-galaxies-based-on-their-shape

There are billions of galaxies discovered in the universe which are of different shapes. 
These galaxies can be classified into different groups based on the shape. 
We aim for the algorithm using machine learning to classify the astronomical data of galaxies to detect their shape. 
We will use astronomical data which is been either made public by the observatories or the data from virtual observatories. 
Our technic will classify the huge dataset of galaxies into the respective type with accuracy
